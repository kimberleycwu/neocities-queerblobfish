# neocities-queerblobfish
i had no idea what the heck neocities was a month ago, but i thought the highly-stylized, uber-personalized pages that were hosted on the site were stellar. in this vein, i tried making my own. the final product turned out a little souless despite being brand-consistent, but i guess that's what happens when you don't have an eye for design.

**disclaimer: i did try a bit of vibe coding with this project, and it's still pretty finnicky (as are most ai tools). i won't be building things with vibes anytime soon.**

### about
the site has four sections:
* 🐡 fishtank - a simple fish minding his business. please don't tap the glass.
* 📝 not twitter - a version on the neocities guestbook. hosted with firebase and allows up to 240 characters per post.
* 💃 recent picks - a bulletin of what's hot in the culture. i'm planning to update this pretty frequently.
* 👋 about - a few lines about the site and links to some socials.
